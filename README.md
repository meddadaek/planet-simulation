# 🌍 Planet Simulation

A simple Python project that simulates planetary motion using physics concepts (gravity, orbits, and velocity).  
This project helps visualize how planets move around a star (like our Solar System).  

---

## ✨ Features
- Simulates multiple planets orbiting a central star 🌞  
- Realistic physics using **Newton’s Law of Gravitation** ⚖️  
- Visual output using `pygame` 🎨  
- Adjustable parameters: mass, velocity, distance, and time step
